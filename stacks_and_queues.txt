### Exercises

> What is the main difference between a stack and a queue?

The order in which new items are added to the data structure. In stacks new items are added to the first position (FIFO). In queues new items are added to the last position (LIFO).

> What are the similarities between stacks and queues?

Items are taken out from the first position and items are stored in a prioritized order. 

> Imagine you are an engineer tasked with implementing the UNDO and REDO options in a word processor such as Microsoft Word. Which data structure would you use for each option and why?

Stack data structure. When you undo you want to recall the last action taken, so when you store the last action you want to put it in the first position so you can `pop` it out.



###Programming Questions

> Given a string, reverse it using a stack. For example, the string "Bloc!" should be converted to "!colB".

Use stack data structure to pop data from the original string in reverse order and push it into a new string.

FUNCTION REVERSE(original)
  INIT a new stack
  FOR each character in original
    CALL stack.push WITH character
  END FOR
  INIT reversed to empty string
  WHILE stack is not empty
    CALL stack.pop RETURNING character
    APPEND character to reversed
  END WHILE
  RETURN reversed
END FUNCTION


> Implement the delete functionality of a stack using one queue. Make a FIFO data structure mirror the functionality of a LIFO data structure.

To delete an item, take all of the elements in the queue one at a time and put them at the end of the queue, except for the last one which should be deleted and returned.


Reverse the data structure so the first element is in the last position. Delete the last element in the reversed structure.


CLASS Stack
 FUNCTION pop(queue)
   FOR each element in queue
      CALL queue.push WITH element
   END FOR
   SET the element at the queue position index to temp
   DECREMENT the queue position index by 1
   RETURN temp
 END FUNCTION
END CLASS


> Fill in the methods for the following Queue class so that it will work as expected (FIFO).

CLASS QUEUE
 FUNCTION enqueue(element)
   APPEND element to the end of the list
 END FUNCTION

 FUNCTION dequeue
   SET temp to the first element
   REMOVE FIRST element of list from list
   RETURN temp
 END FUNCTION
END CLASS
