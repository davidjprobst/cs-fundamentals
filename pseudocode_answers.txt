Short Answer

1. Why do programmers use pseudocode?
	
Pseudocode is a way to work through and write out logic without having to focus on getting the correct syntax for the language you are writing in. It is a good way to work through programming problems before writing actual code.

2. If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?

It would not work because it is not an actual programming language.



Programming Assignment
Write the following algorithms in pseudocode:

1. Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

INPUT two numbers

  IF firstNumber IS GREATER THAN secondNumber
    PRINT firstNumber
    
  ELSE IF secondNumber IS GREATER THAN firstNumber
    PRINT secondNumber
    
  ELSE IF firstNumber IS EQUAL TO secondNumber
    PRINT "These two numbers are equal"

  END IF

END

2. Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

LET count EQUAL 1
  IF count IS LESS THAN 100
    PRINT count AND INCREMENT count by ONE
  END IF
END

3. Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

receive INPUT
  IF INPUT is a string
     FILTER contact numbers that partially match the input string AND RETURN the matching contacts
  ELSE IF INPUT is a number
     FILTER contact numbers that partially match the input number AND RETURN the matching contacts
  END IF
END
     

4. Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

function findPerson(searchText) {
   const regexp = new RegExp(searchText, 'i');
   if (typeof searchText == 'string') {
      return listedNumbers.filter(listedNumber => regexp.test(listedNumber.name));
   } else if (typeof searchText == 'number') {
      return listedNumbers.filter(listedNumber => regexp.test(listedNumber.number)); 
   }
}
