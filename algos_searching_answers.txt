### Short Answer

1. What is a real-life scenario that uses linear search?

> Looking for a person in a line. If you start at the front of the line, check if each person in line is the person you are looking for until you find the person you are looking for. 



2. What is a real-life scenario that uses binary search?

> Searching for a book in a bookshelf that is organized in alphabetical order by title. Starting in the middle, if the title you're looking for comes before the middle book, find the middle of the lower section. If the title you are looking for comes after the middle book find the middle of the higher section. Repeat this process until you find the book you are looking for. 



3. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using linear search?

> 7



4. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?

> 3



5. Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

> Linear search. Binary search would not work in this situation because it requires a sorted collection. 



6. Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

> Binary search. It will work in this situation because it is a sorted collection. Linear search would still work, but binary search requires much less iteration because the data set is halved in each iteration.




### Programming Assignment

1. You and a friend have set a wager to see who can find the word "Albatross" in the dictionary the fastest. Write a program to allow you to win the bet.


function findAlbatross(collection, albatross) {
   let low = 0
   let high = collection.length - 1

   while (low <= high) {
      let mid = (low + high) / 2;
      if ( collection[mid].localeCompare("albatross") === 1 ) {
         let high = mid - 1;
      } else if ( collection[mid].localeCompare("albatross") === -1 ) {
         let low = mid + 1;
      } else {
         return collection[mid];
      }
   };

   return "Albatross is not in the dictionary"
}




2. You work at a pet store, and a child has asked you to net the only white-spotted goldfish from the fish tank. Write a program that will help you net the right fish.


function findFish(collection, desiredFish) {
   for(var i = 0; i < collection.length; i++) {
      caughtFish = collection[i];
      if(caughtFish === desiredFish) {
         return "You caught the fish you're looking for!";
      }
   }
   return "The fish you're looking for is not in this tank"
}
